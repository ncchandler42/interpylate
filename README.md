Quick Python Tk interface to get accurate values off of an onscreen graph

## How?
To use, run the script to open the main window. Set the axes' ranges from the graph using the boxes on the right,
and then click the "Set points" buttons to click those same coordinates on the screen. Once both axes are set, 
click the "Get point" button and highlight/click the desired point on the curve.

## Why?
